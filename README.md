## DataProcessing
A collection of scripts that serve to process data from a dataset by managing its values, graphing the set, and creating predictive models of the set.

*	Start a Juypter Notebook instance by running "Juypter Notebook" in the same directory as the iPythons
*	Juypter will start and automatically open a window where the iPythons can be viewed and ran.
